# Speed Learning Time Converter

While the name be weird this is just a fun little program that I decided to do to allow me and hopefully many others to see the hypothetical time it would take them to listen, or watch the podcaast, audiobook, course or any other learning material if they decided to speed up the source by say 1.5  for example. 

I decided to create a GUI for this program because who doesn't like user-friendly programs am I right? But in all seriousness I decided to do my first PyQt5 program with this because it seemed like it wouldnt be to hard so hope you enjoy!
